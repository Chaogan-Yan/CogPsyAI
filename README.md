Welcome to the **CogPsy AI Program** repository! This course is led by **Prof. Yan** at THU. Each team is provided with a dedicated THU CogPsy AI training platform account, to explore imaginative AI experiments in **Cognitive Psychology**.

## Overview

1. **Develop a Deep Learning Model**  
   Integrate various cognitive concepts into your model’s design.  
   Utilize **fMRI-based brain activity time series** to predict and decode thinking processes.
2. **Project Collaboration**  
   Form teams and collaboratively conduct experiments that combine advanced deep learning with cognitive theories.  
   Encourage creativity by training new models named after each student.
3. **Repository Contributions**  
   Upload your code and reports to this repository.  
   Provide sufficient documentation to ensure reproducibility and clarity for all collaborators.

## Objectives

- **Advance Cognitive-AI Integration**:  
   Merge cognitive psychology theories with contemporary AI techniques.  
- **Innovate fMRI-Based Models**:  
   Experiment with fMRI data to decode mental states and predict brain activity patterns.  
- **Promote Collaboration**:  
   Share your findings and insights with fellow participants to foster a productive learning environment.  
- **Encourage Creativity**:  
   Develop unique strategies and architectures, challenging conventional deep learning norms.

## Getting Started

- **Clone the Repository**  
   git clone https://github.com/Chaogan-Yan/CogPsyAI.git

- **Set Up the Training Environment**  
   Use the THU CogPsy AI training platform or your local environment.
        Ensure you have access to the Huawei Ascend 910B2 chips or GPUs.
        Install dependencies listed in each sub-project’s requirements.txt.

- **Implement Your Model**  
   Experiment with fMRI data and integrate relevant cognitive concepts.
        Focus on efficient training and inference pipelines using Ascend 910B2 chips.

- **Document & Share**  
   Each team should create a subfolder with a descriptive name for their project.
        Include code, scripts, notebooks, and a comprehensive README to explain the project’s workflow, design, and results.

- **Submit a Pull Request**  
   Once completed, merge your code and documentation into the main repository.

## Code of Conduct  
- **Collaboration & Respect:**  
    Maintain a supportive, respectful environment; share ideas and help each other troubleshoot.
- **Integrity & Ethics:**  
   Follow standard research and academic guidelines. Reference all sources appropriately and handle data responsibly.
- **Innovation & Creativity:**  
   Use your imagination to explore emerging techniques and unorthodox solutions.
